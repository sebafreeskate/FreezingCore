# FreezingCore

This project is something like a self-made game engine developed just for fun.

Now it consists of the real-time rendering system based on OpenGL api, assets loading system and human interface system for camera rotation, movement etc.
There are still many things i'm going to implement here ... someday.

Please note: project contains git submodules as third party libraries, to clone project properly use git clone --recurse-submodules or initialize each submodule with git submodule init, git submodule update .
